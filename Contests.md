# Scripting Contest #
_17 January 2010_ - The purpose of this contest was to stress-test GrafX2 new scripting capabilities.
DawnBringer and Nitrofurano submitted many Lua scripts, their original submissions can be browsed in the svn history, [here](http://code.google.com/p/grafx2/source/browse/?r=1374#svn/trunk/scripts).

# GrafX2 13th birthday contest #
_16 July 2009_ - This month (the exact date was lost, sorry :)) is GrafX2? 13th birthday. We want to celebrate it with a little challenge. The idea is that you draw a picture and send it to us (send them to grafx2@googlegroups.com). Of course the picture should be made entirely in grafx2. There is no other constraint : you can go for strict pixelart (using only the freehand tool), scene style graphics, isometric, sprites, or freestyle using all the advanced effects (transparency, smear, ...).
