# Spare page / Copy current to spare #

## Left click ##

Jumps to spare page. The current page is then considered as the new spare page, and the spare page considered as the new current page.

## Right click ##

Opens a menu where you can choose whether you want to copy the whole picture (keyboard short-cut in this menu is [Return](Return.md)), only the pixels, only the palette, or only some colors. In this last case, a second menu ([stencil-like](DrawingEffects.md)) will propose you to tag the colors you want to copy (they are all selected by default).

The last option the menu ("Copy palette and remap"), remaps the spare page with the current palette and replicates this palette to the spare page. This option is useful to quickly remap a picture with the palette of another.
