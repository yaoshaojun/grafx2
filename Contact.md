It's a public mailing-list, so be aware that your message and e-mail address will be visible at the [Grafx2 google group (ext)](http://groups.google.com/group/grafx2)

The mailing-list is moderated by default, so you'll need to wait for a moderator to check that your message is not spam to green-light it. If you subscribe to the mailing-list itself, we can then white-list you so all your messages are sent immediately.
