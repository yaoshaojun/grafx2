# Polygons / Polyforms #

## Left click ##

Selects the polygons as the active drawing tool.

This works just like [knotted-lines](Lines.md) but loops the extremities when you're finished.

## Right click ##

Selects the polyforms as the active drawing tool.

This works like a combination of [free-hand drawing](FreeHandDraw.md) and [knotted-lines](Lines.md). If you keep the mouse button pressed, you'll draw as if you were in free-hand drawing mode. And, if you release the mouse button, it will work like knotted lines.

Click on the opposite mouse button (i.e.: click right if you started to draw with the left mouse button, and vice versa) to terminate the operation. The two extremities will be linked automatically.

# Polyfills / Filled polyforms #

Work exactly the same way as the polygons et polyforms above, but fill in the interior of the drawn shapes.
