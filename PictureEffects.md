# Adjust picture / Effects on the picture #

## Left click ##

Allows you to scroll the picture to re-center your graph for example.

Any part of the picture that goes out of the image by a side comes back by the opposite one.

Left-clicking the picture will scroll only the active layer. Right-clicking will scroll all of them.

It is assimilated to the drawing tools family.


## Right click ##
Opens the Picture Transform menu.

#### RESCALE ####

Allows you to change the image's size, rescaling it accordingly. Enter new size and press RESIZE to confirm.

When 'Lock proportions' is checked and you change one dimension, the other one is automatically adjusted to preserve the proportions of the original image.

You can use the dropdown button to choose between three ways to enter the dimensions:
  * In 'Pixels' mode, the column 'old' shows the original dimensions, and you can set the new size in pixels.
  * In 'Percent' mode, you set a percentage compared to the original image.
  * In 'Ratio' mode, you can set 2 numbers for each dimension, and the resizing factor will be of 'new'÷'old'. For example you can use 1:3 to divide the image by three, 2:1 to double it, and any fraction like 15:16.

Be careful that moving from one mode to the next can lose precision, if the selected dimensions cannot be represented exactly in the new mode.
