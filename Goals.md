# Project goals and development guidelines #

## Original goals ##

From Sunset Design, when they started in 1996

  * This software has been created for YOU, PC users who envy [Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) owners for their fantastic paint programs. This software doesn't pretend to replace the best programs on Amiga, but it modestly tries to fill the gap between PC and Amiga in the field of bitmap drawing.
  * This program is designed for drawing **256-color pictures** in a huge range of (...) **video resolutions** that aren't the common PC modes.

## Current Development ##

_pulkomandy:_
  * Provide a painting program on **Linux**
  * For **[Amstrad CPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC)** cross-development

_yrizoud:_
  * **Adapt** when technology changes: hardware, software.
  * Keep it **familiar** for all the artists who have years of practice of the DOS version.
  * Integrate some features that were present in **Deluxe Paint**. _It's the spiritual father of GrafX2, so the result shouldn't be too Frankenstein-ish. Besides, a number of Grafx2 users are also skilled in Deluxe Paint._
  * In all matters, keep ambitions **realistic**. _Work, motivation, and time are precious. Chasing rainbows would be a waste._
