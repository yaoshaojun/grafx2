#summary List of file formats that grafx2 can save and load

= Introduction =

Grafx2 under DOS has support for various file formats from other drawing tools. Each format's saving and loading routines have been rewritten to support the format on all platforms, with big-endian or little-endian CPU, and with no problems of byte alignment.
Here is a table showing the status of each format.

= Supported formats table =

|| *Extension* || *Save* || *Load* || *Misc* ||
|| [PKMSpec PKM] || Yes || Yes || Grafx2 own format  ||
|| LBM || Yes || Yes || Electronic arts ||
|| GIF || Partial || Partial || Compuserve GIF 87a. GrafX2 skips the extended data that records which color is *transparent*, *animation frames*, and tricks to assemble an image from several layers. If you re-save an image that had this kind of information, GrafX2 *removes it*. Saving is always in 8-bit palette (256 colors), and 1-bit files (2 color) cannot be read.||
|| PNG || Yes || Yes except RGB|| Portable Network Graphics. Reads all forms of paletted images (from 2 to 256 colors), greyscale (any depth, converted to a 256-level greyscale palette from black to white). Additional PNG information, like Alpha channel and Transparency are not preserved. The image description is read and saved as the 'Title' text, limited to 32 characters.||
|| BMP || Yes || Most || Microsoft Paint. Some variants of Bitmaps cannot be loaded, neither by the original GrafX2 nor by our version. ||
|| PCX || Yes || Yes || Z-Soft ||
|| IMG || Yes || Yes || Bivas (W. Wiedmann) ||
|| SC? || Yes || Yes || Colorix ||
|| PI1 || Yes || Yes || Degas Elite ||
|| PC1 || Yes || Yes || Degas Elite ||
|| CEL || Yes || Yes || K.O.S. (KISekae Set System) ||
|| KCF || Yes || Yes || K.O.S. (KISekae Set System) ||
|| PAL || Yes || Yes || ||
