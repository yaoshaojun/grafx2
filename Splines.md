# Splines #

## Left click ##

Selects the current curve-drawing mode as the active drawing tool. There are 2 different curve-drawing modes:

  * 4 control points curves: define the basic line like a classical line, then move, with the left mouse button, the inner control points to choose the shape of your curve. When the curve has the shape you want, click with the right mouse button to draw it definitively.

  * 3 control points curves: the same as above, but you'll have only one inner control point to place. Moreover, the spline will be traced just after placing this point.


## Right click ##

Toggles the different curve-drawing modes and activates, at the same time, the curve-drawing tool.
