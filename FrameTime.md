# Animation Speed #

Opens the 'animation speed' window. This window displays the duration of the current animation frame, in milliseconds.

You can:
  * Change this frame's duration.
  * Change the duration of all frames.
  * Alter the duration of all frames by adding a number of milliseconds. You can use negative numbers to reduce the durations instead.
