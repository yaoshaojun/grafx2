# Layer selection #

This displays as many numbered icons as your image has layers. Layer 1 acts as background, layer 2 is displayed above it, etc. The appearance of the icons change when the layer is the current one for drawing, or when it's made invisible.

## Left click ##

Choose a layer as the current one for drawing.

## Right click ##

Makes a layer visible or invisible. If you click the current layer, this toggles the visibility of all other layers instead.
