# Kill currenty page #

## Any click ##

Removes the current page from the list of "Undo" pages. This allows you to free some memory if you need it. For instance, this will allow you to delete the start-up page after having loaded an image. A message will appear if you've already erased all the pages except the last one.

Note: Another way to free some memory is to decrease the number of "Undo" pages. Or else, if you have recentlt grabbed a very big brush that you don't use any more, you can grab a new smaller one. The memory allocated by the big brush will be thus freed.
