# Layers menu #

In this menu you can set the following options:

  * **Transparent color** : This determines which color index is considered transparent when using layers. Click the button and then click on the image to pick the right color, or use ESC to cancel.

  * **Transparent background** : When this option is checked, all pixels of the transparent color on layer 1 (background layer) will be tagged as transparent in the final image. Check this option if you want to make a transparent GIF or PNG. These are the only file formats that support this option.
