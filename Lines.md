# Left click: #
Selects the current line-drawing mode as the active drawing tool. There are 3 line-drawing modes:
  * Classical lines: when first clicking on the picture, you'll define the start of the line. Maintain your click to choose the end of the line and release the mouse button to set it. If you hold the SHIFT key, the line will be constrained to horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
  * Knotted lines: works like classical lines, but the end of your line will automatically become the start of the next one. When you want to stop chaining lines, use the opposite mouse button. "The opposite button" means that if you started to draw lignes with the left button (Fore-color), you'll have to stop the procedure with the right button; and conversely.
  * Concentric lines: when first clicking on the picture, you'll define the center of the lines. In fact, the center is defined by the position of the mouse when you release the mouse button. Then you can draw lines from the center to the current mouse position by clicking. To stop drawing concentric lines, use the opposite mouse button. This drawing tool allows to change the fore and back colors when being in use.

# Right click: #
Toggles the different line-drawing modes and activates, at the same time, the line-drawing tool.
